This is the repository for my second robot in the FTC 2022-2023 Power Play Season that competed in the Pennsylvania State Championship. While we spent much time buiding a claw mechanism and two viper slides for scoring, my focus was on building, optimizing, and programming the drive train.

Our previous robot had issues due to a poorly built drive train that lacked weight distribution, size optimization, and stability. To avoid these problems, we built this robot with symmetry and added counterweights by balancing it on a makeshift fulcrum. As a result, it had smooth and precise movement in all directions.

As the lead programmer, my main motivation for creating an accurate drive train was to utilize the new FTC libraries I had been spending my time learning about, especially RoadRunner. RoadRunner uses PID and feedforward controllers for localization and autonomous movement. With the precise drive train, I am currently working on building a 1+5 autonomous mode.

Although my team did not advance to the World Championships this year, this season was an incredible opportunity to learn a ton about engineering, electrical, and of course programming. This was my school's first year competing in FTC Robotics and I started knowing just the basics of programming a robot to now feeling ready to tackle any programming demands that a robot might throw at me.
